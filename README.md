# NY Car Crash Data Analysis and Visualization
This project was developed as part of a volunteer initiative for a non-profit organization, aimed at analyzing and visualizing traffic accident data in New York City. By leveraging Python for data preprocessing and Power BI for visualization, this project provides actionable insights to help improve urban safety and inform public policy.

## Dataset Overview
- **Source:** Comprehensive U.S. traffic accident dataset spanning from February 2016 to March 2023.
- **NY Specific Data:** A focused subset of 347960 records related to traffic incidents in New York, extracted from the original dataset of approximately 7.7 million records.

## Data Preparation
- **Filtering:** Targeted extraction of New York state-specific crash data.
- **Cleaning:** Addressed missing values, removed non-essential columns, and standardized categorical data, especially for weather conditions.
- **Categorization:** Developed new categorical variables to enhance the analytical capabilities of the dataset, such as weather condition classifications.

## Power BI Enhancements
- **Data Calculations:** Additional data fields were computed within Power BI to support comprehensive visual analysis.
- **Dynamic Measures:** Implemented DAX formulas to classify crash times and categorize weather conditions, enabling more nuanced insights.

## Key Research Questions
The analysis is guided by several critical questions:

- **Spatial Distribution:** Where are traffic accidents most likely to occur in NYC?
- **Temporal Patterns:** Are there specific times of day, days of the week, or months when accidents are more frequent?
- **Impact of Environmental Factors:** How do weather conditions influence the frequency and severity of accidents?
- **Infrastructure & Safety Measures:** What role do traffic signals, road infrastructure, and safety measures play in accident occurrences?
